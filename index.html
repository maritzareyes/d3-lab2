         <p>
             This map depicts the five main land use types of Africa: Urban, Agriculture, Forest, Water, and Others.
         </p>
          <p>  
              Africa is currently the least urbanized continent, but its urbanization rate of 3.5 percent per year is the fastest in the world. In 1980, only 28 percent of Africans lived in urban areas. Today, the number of Africans living in cities is 40 percent, and is projected to grow to 50 percent by 2030. The McKinsey Global Institute projects that by 2016, over 500 million Africans will live in urban areas, and 65 African cities will have populations of over 1 million.
          </p>
        <p>
            Agriculture in Africa has a massive social and economic footprint. More than 60 percent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is smallholder farmers, and about 23 percent of sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s GDP comes from agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Congo Basin is Africa's largest contiguous forest and the second-largest tropical rainforest in the world. Covering about 695,000 square miles, this swamp-struck tropical forest covers portions of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.The Congo Basin forests are inhabited by 30-70 million people, many of whom are dependent upon forests for firewood, hunting and shifting cultivation.
        </p>
        <p>
             Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in sub-Saharan Africa and a rapidly rising population is increasing food demand and water scarcity. Staple food and export crops are often produced inefficiently, consuming more water resources and getting less yield than the global benchmark for these crops.
